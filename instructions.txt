hank you so much for your time! Really appreciate it.

We can start by focussing on the three following topics:
- HIV Care Continuum
- Clinical Quality Management
- People with HIV & Community Involvement

The Process:
- Would be helpful to have all files, videos and supporting documents offline. In case there are none on a given page, it would be helpful to have the webpage for it.
- Would be ideal if the files could be saved to folders & subfolders on Box/Drive corresponding to the topic & sub-topic on the website.  

Addendum | Instructions we received for the exercise FYR:

    Identify and download relevant resources from TargetHIV, particularly those related to: EHE Implementation, continuous quality improvement, implementation science, evaluation, housing, social media/marketing campaigns, community engagement, procurement, data use/epidemiology, any standards/SOPs for HIV treatment/response.

    Organize resources in our EHE-TAP Box folder: a) Create a folder structure based on the categories above, b) Use a consistent naming convention for files (eg. Category_Name of Document_Organization_Date).

    Develop an index in excel (also saved on Box), with the following fields: category, document title, author/organization, date of publication, keywords, link to document on Box, and any other fields that you think would make searching and retrieving resources more efficient.  

Please do let me know if you have any questions. My cell is +1 202 276 9890 for quicker access.

Thanks again!

Warmly,
Sucharita

    Dear Shannon,

    Thank you once again for being the best!!

    We're a bit worried about the TARGET HIV site going dark as of 30th June, and need to have an offline database ready to continue working effectively on the EHE project. We're looking at 4000+ resources + files and hyperlinks nested within these pages under a very short timeline.

    Any help in fast-tracking the process would be deeply appreciated. 

    Here's a link to the resources on the TARGET HIV site: https://targethiv.org/resources?at-y8cIiWa0=iBxDfkAB&at-iBxDfkAB=gX9qoaiz&at-gX9qoaiz=ReC6UofA&at-ReC6UofA=tzg&antibot_key=zgAtof6UeCzRaiqoX9BgkADfBx0iWaIi8cey814gFos&f[0]=topic_areas_for_resources_search_block%3A1653&at-sFo4g81e=y8cIiWa0&page=1 

    Under the Advanced Search, we need all the resources under "Topics" downloaded. This includes papers, videos, supporting reading materials, blogs etc. 

    We can prioritize the following "Topics":
     - HIV Care Continuum
    - Clinical Quality Management
    - People with HIV & Community Involvement
