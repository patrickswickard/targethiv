        <p><p>Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage is divided into four distinct phases, each with a specific dollar amount that serves as a threshold leading into the following phase: (1) deductible phase, (2) initial coverage period, (3) coverage gap or “donut hole” phase, and (4) catastrophic coverage period.</p><p>Phase 1: In the <em><strong>deductible</strong></em> phase, individuals are responsible for paying the full negotiated price for their prescription drugs, until they reach a specific deductible amount. In 2024, this amount is $545. Once this amount has been reached, the individual moves into the next phase of coverage.</p><p>Phase 2: In the<em><strong> initial coverage period</strong></em> phase, both the individual and their health plan collectively pay towards out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, until they reach a specific amount, called the out-of-pocket threshold. In 2024, this amount is $5,030. Once this amount has been reached, the individual moves into the next phase of coverage.</p><p>Phase 3: In the <em><strong>coverage gap or “donut hole”</strong></em> phase, the individual is required to pay up to 25 percent of the costs of their prescription drugs (both brand name drugs and generics), until they reach a specific amount, called the out-of-pocket spending threshold. In 2024, this amount is $8,000. Once this amount has been reached, the individual moves into the final phase of coverage.</p><p>Phase 4: In the <em><strong>catastrophic coverage period</strong></em> phase, individuals pay zero copayments and coinsurance for their prescription drugs for the remainder of the plan year (effective January 1, 2024).</p><p>Find more information about <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/costs-in-the-coverage-gap">costs in the coverage gap</a> on the CMS website.</p></p>

If the client prefers Medicare Advantage, they must elect to enroll during the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some states, some individuals who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid can be automatically enrolled into a specific type of Medicare Advantage plan called a Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP), but that is not the general policy for the majority of Medicare-only enrollees.</p>

      <p>How and when can my client switch between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage, or make changes to their prescription drug coverage without penalties or gaps in coverage?</p>

    </summary>
    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>Depending on what type of Medicare coverage your client is already enrolled in and what changes they want to make to their coverage, there are multiple times throughout the year that this is possible. Generally, a person can <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/joining-a-health-or-drug-plan">join, switch, or drop coverage</a> without penalties or gaps in coverage if they do so during specific Open Enrollment periods or Special Enrollment Periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>From January 1 - March 31, a person can switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another Medicare Advantage plan, or switch from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare (Parts A and B) and join a Part D plan.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>From October 15 - December 7, a person can switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage or vice versa, join a Medicare drug plan if they didn’t have one already, switch from one Medicare drug plan to another, or drop Medicare drug coverage completely, among other things.</li>
</ul>

<p>The client can also call 1-800-MEDICARE or their Medicare Advantage plan to request disenrollment outside of the Open Enrollment period. Before moving from Medicare Advantage to Original Medicare, it is a good idea for clients to check with all of their health care providers to make sure that switching to Original Medicare won’t cause any disruptions in care.&nbsp;<br>

      <p>Does the 7 month Medicare Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) refer to calendar months or actual days?</p>

    </summary>
    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>Calendar months. The Medicare Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) is a seven (7) month period centered around an individual’s 65th birthday month. It includes the individual’s birthday month, the three (3) calendar months prior to the birthday month, and the three (3) calendar months after the birthday month. For this reason, the IEP is sometimes referred to as the “3-1-3” period. For example, if your birthday is on May 15, your Initial Enrollment Period would begin on February 1 and end on August 31. This includes the three (3) calendar months prior to your birthday (February, March, and April), your birthday month (May), and the three (3) calendar months after your birthday (June, July, and August).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: If your birthday is on the 1st of the month, your seven-month Initial Enrollment Period is distributed differently. It will include the four (4) calendar months before your birthday, your birthday month, and the two (2) calendar months after your birthday. Instead of a “3-1-3” distribution, it becomes a “4-1-2” distribution. For example, if your birthday is on May 1, your Initial Enrollment Period would begin on January 1 and end on July 31. This includes the four (4) calendar months prior to your birthday (January, February, March, and April), your birthday month (May), and the two (2) calendar months after your birthday (June and July).</p>

    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>It depends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generally, if a client qualified for Medicare via the SSDI disability pathway and subsequently loses their SSDI benefits, they will also lose Medicare coverage unless they also qualify on the basis of age (65 or older) or if they have End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD).</p>

<p>However, there are also a number of programs that support people receiving SSDI to engage in trial work periods while maintaining eligibility for SSDI benefits and Medicare. Even after a trial work period ends and a person loses their SSDI benefits, they may still be able to maintain Medicare coverage for a certain period of time.</p>

    </summary>
    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>There are many health conditions and impairments that the Social Security Administration (SSA) recognizes as qualifying disabilities (called listings). These include: musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory disorders, neurological disorders, mental disorders, immune system disorders, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individuals under age 65 can qualify for Medicare if they have a qualifying disability (as determined by the SSA) and have been receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits for at least 24 consecutive or non-consecutive months. Individuals with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) can qualify for Medicare at any age, without first having to receive SSDI benefits for 24 month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: According to the SSA, a diagnosis of HIV alone is not considered a qualifying disability for the purposes of SSDI eligibility. Individuals with HIV can qualify for SSDI if they have either a serious HIV-related condition, a qualifying CD4 count, repeated hospitalizations, or repeated manifestations of HIV.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>No, however individuals who have received 24 months of SSDI benefits will be automatically enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B when they begin receiving their 25th month of SSDI benefits. After auto-enrollment occurs, individuals can choose to keep or decline their coverage.</p>

<p>For Medicare Part A, individuals can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep their premium-free Medicare Part A coverage&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Decline their Medicare Part A coverage, withdraw their original Social Security application, and pay back all Social Security cash benefits</li>

<p>In such cases, it is advantageous for clients to enroll in one or more Medicare Parts (especially premium-free Part A) if the client needs or wants assistance with Medicare cost-sharing (through Medicare Savings Programs), prescription drug cost-sharing (through the Extra Help program), and behavioral health and/or long-term care costs.&nbsp;</p>

Contact your state Medicaid program, which administers MSPs, to see what MSP options are available in your state. If you believe that your client meets the criteria for an MSP in your state, then you should help them apply for that program. Many RWHAP clients who qualify for Medicare may qualify for an MSP on the basis of income.

      <p>If a client is dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, are their prescriptions covered?</p>

    </summary>
    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>Generally, yes. Dually eligible people get their prescription drug coverage through Medicare, either through a standalone Medicare Part D plan (added on to Original Medicare) or through a Medicare Advantage plan. All Medicare prescription drug plans must cover HIV medications, including antiretroviral treatments (ART). Some state Medicaid programs also provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the client is interested in whether a specific medication is covered, especially non-HIV medications, they should contact their Medicare and Medicaid plan administrators and ask if it is covered by the plan’s formulary.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>No. If an individual has Medicare coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan and Medicaid coverage through a Medicaid managed care plan, it is possible <em>but not required </em>for the Medicare Advantage plan and the Medicaid managed care plan to be administered by the same insurance company. There may be potential benefits to such an arrangement, such as having to contact only one insurance company instead of two. However, they will still have to navigate two separate sets of coverage and benefits, as well as billing requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: This type of arrangement is not the same as enrolling in a single integrated care plan that is administered by one insurer, which provides a higher level of care coordination.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="accordionpanel accordion__contents">
      <div class="field-content">
        <p><p>It depends. A person who is dually eligible and does not have access to an integrated care plan may benefit from enrolling in a Medicare Advantage plan (as well as their state Medicaid program) instead of Original Medicare if they:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Anticipate needing extra benefits such as vision, dental, and hearing services that Original Medicare does not offer</li>
	<li>Have existing providers who are part of the Medicare Advantage plan’s network</li>
	<li>Do not anticipate needing health care when traveling outside of the country</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: There are special types of Medicare Advantage plans, called Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs), that are available only to dually eligible people. D-SNPs tailor their benefits, provider networks, and drug formularies to meet the unique needs of dually eligible people. D-SNP enrollees are not required to also enroll in their state Medicaid program, as Medicaid benefits are already included in the plan.&nbsp;</p>

This additional penalty amount must be paid monthly for as long as the individual has Medicare Part B coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if an individual was eligible for Medicare Part B but chose not to enroll in coverage for 2.5 years (30 months), they will have to pay an additional 20% (10% x 2, 12-month periods) on top of their monthly Part B premium for as long as they have Part B.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/medicare-costs/avoid-penalties">Medicare Part D penalty</a> is 1% of the national base beneficiary premium (a benchmark amount that changes annually) multiplied by the number of full, uncovered months that an individual was eligible for Medicare Part D but did not enroll or did not have creditable prescription drug coverage. This additional penalty (rounded to the nearest $0.10) must be paid monthly for as long as the individual has Medicare Part D coverage.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if an individual was eligible for Medicare Part D but chose not to enroll or did not have other creditable prescription drug coverage for 17 months, they will have to pay 17% (1% x 17 full, uncovered months) of the national base beneficiary premium. In 2022, this number was $33.37, so the penalty is $5.70 (17% x $33.37, rounded to the nearest $0.10) on top of their monthly Part D premium for as long as they have Part D.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p>

However, the client may still be eligible for other Medicaid eligibility categories in addition to Medicare and will be reassessed for other Medicaid eligibility categories before they turn 65. (Note: this process was different during the COVID-19 pandemic when Medicaid programs were prohibited from terminating coverage, see the question below for more information). The client may also be eligible for a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-savings-programs">Medicare Savings Program</a>, where Medicaid can help pay for their Medicare premium and reduce their cost-sharing obligations.&nbsp;</li><li>If the client is under 65 and enrolled in Medicaid based on another eligibility category (e.g., disability), and then becomes eligible for Medicare when they turn 65, they may continue to be eligible for full Medicaid coverage (depending on the state) in addition to being eligible for Medicare. Some state Medicaid programs end Medicaid coverage at age 65, and clients should check in with their state Medicaid programs to understand eligibility rules. Dually eligible clients may be entitled to some Medicaid services that Medicare does not cover. As stated above, even if the client is no longer eligible for another full Medicaid eligibility category, they may still be eligible for a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-savings-programs">Medicare Savings Program</a> to help with Medicare costs. If a client was enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare and subsequently loses Medicaid coverage, they are eligible for a Special Enrollment Period to pick a Medicare Advantage plan or to enroll in traditional Medicare. This is because they will no longer be eligible for a specific type of Medicare Advantage plan only available to dually eligible enrollees called a Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP).</li></ul></p>

In these circumstances, ADAP administrators should ensure RWHAP recipients and subrecipients are aware of this requirement, and case managers and other support staff should be trained on how to discuss the MPPP with clients and why their ADAP is recommending clients do not enroll.
